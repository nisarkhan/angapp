				<text><![CDATA[I promise to pay the Total of Payments to the order of you, the Lender. I will make the payments at your address above. I will make the payments on the dates and in the amounts shown in the Payment Schedule. If I don't pay an entire payment within 10 days after it is due, you can charge me a late charge. For a loan that has an amount financed of less than $100, the late charge for a payment that is unpaid for 10 days after it is due is 5% of the amount of the installment. For a loan that has an amount financed of $100 or more, the late charge for a payment that is unpaid for 10 days after it is due is the greater of $10 or 5% of the amount of the installment. If I don't pay all I owe when the final payment becomes due, I will pay interest on the amount that is still unpaid. That interest will be at a rate of 18% per year and will begin the day after the final payment becomes due.

I can make any payment early. The acquisition charge on this loan will not be refunded if I pay off early. If I pay all I owe before the beginning of the last monthly period, I will save part of the installment account handling charge. You will figure the amount I save by the Sum of the Periodic Balances Method. This method is explained in the Finance Commission rules. You don't have to refund or credit any amount less than $1.

If I ask for more time to make any payment and you allow me more time, I will pay additional interest to extend the payment. The additional interest will be figured as provided in the Finance Commission rules. I agree to pay you a reasonable fee of up to $30
for a returned check. You can add the fee to the amount I owe under this agreement or collect it separately.

If I break any of my promises in this document, you can demand that I immediately pay all that I owe. You can also do this if you in good faith believe that I am not going to be willing or able to keep all of my promises. I agree that you don't have to give me notice that you are demanding or intend to demand immediate payment of all that I owe.

If I am giving collateral for this loan, I will see the separate security agreement for more information and agreements.

I will keep all of my promises in this document. If there is more than one Borrower, each Borrower agrees to keep all of the promises in this document, even if the other Borrowers do not. I promise that all information I gave you is true.

If you don't enforce your rights every time, you can still enforce them later. Federal law and Texas law apply to this contract.
I don't have to pay interest or other amounts that are more than the law allows.

Any change to this agreement has to be in writing. Both you and I have to sign it. You can mail any notice to me at my last address in your records.

WE MAY REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNT TO CREDIT BUREAUS. LATE PAYMENTS, MISSED PAYMENTS, OR OTHER DEFAULTS ON YOUR ACCOUNT
MAY BE REFLECTED IN YOUR CREDIT REPORT.
